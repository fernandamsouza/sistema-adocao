# AdotAÃ­ - System of adoption, sale and location of lost animals

With the objective of centralizing the means of acquiring an animal, and facilitating communication between the actors involved in this action, the project aims to help the adoption and sale of pets, as well as the dissemination of lost animals.

This project aims not only to help people looking for pets, but also the animals themselves. In addition, it can also help animal shelters which in most cases suffer from overcrowding. With a centralized solution for adoption, this attitude can be facilitated for both sides, both the adopter and the donor.
